# CMST-185-Final-Project

This project was a bit challenging. Part of this was because I was only working on it in the studio class and was not taking advantage of time outside of the class to further progress along and have a more completed project. Each week I began working on it in class I had to back track and remember what I was doing and what I was potentially going to change to make the program work like it needed to. This was especially apparent when I needed to make some changes in the websockets themselves because I wasn't entirely familiar with them. The learning curve was pretty steep but I did learn alot about websockets.
Overall, this project had taught me quite a bit about websockets and I would love to do some more work with them and hopefully make a more advanced program than what was done here.
